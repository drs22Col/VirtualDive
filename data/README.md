## Data Sources:

`SEDAC_POP_2000-01-01_rgb_1440x720.SS.CSV` is a reupload from https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=SEDAC_POP

`ReefLocations.csv` is a reupload of the Reef Locations CSV from http://reefbase.org/gis_maps/datasets.aspx

`GBIFData.csv` is the results of a scrape of GBIF. This is not used in the current iteration of the Bokeh tutorial but will be used in future versions of VirtualDive.

The rest of the CSV files are modified/cleaned versions of these original files. I have reuploaded these to GitHub rather than using them directly so that if the providers alter them in the future, the notebook tutorials don't break.
