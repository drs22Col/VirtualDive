## Data Sources:

`SEDAC_POP_2000-01-01_rgb_1440x720.SS.CSV` is a reupload from https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/view.php?datasetId=SEDAC_POP

`ReefLocations.csv` is a reupload of the Reef Locations CSV from http://reefbase.org/gis_maps/datasets.aspx

The rest of the CSV files are modified/cleaned versions of these CSV files. I have reuploaded these files to GitHub rather than using them directly so that if the providers change the files in the future, the notebook tutorials don't break.
