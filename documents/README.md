# Project Proposal

1) **The problem** 

Based on my searches, there are currently no programs that makes it easy for scientists to download publicly accessible oceanographic data from PacIOOS and run larval simulations and visualize them. Thus, my goal is to create a program that scrapes the data and outputs formatted data into the LarvalDispersal class of the GeoEco package (http://code.env.duke.edu/projects/mget). 

2) **The data**

This project will make use of the ocean currents forecasts of Samoa from the Pacific Island Ocean Observing System (PacIOOS). The PacIOOS has fine-scale forecasts of ocean currents but does not have actual observed surface ocean currents for the region. If possible, the data of PacIOOS will be compared with the lower resolution (0.33 degree x 0.33 degree spatial resolution - 5 day temporal resolution) data from NASA JPL's OSCAR to verify that the predictions from both systems are in agreement. 

3) **The tools**
