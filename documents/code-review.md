**1) In reviewing your peer's projects did you find that their README files made it clear what their project is, how to install it, and how to use it? Do you think that your README file does a good job at this?**

**Montana**: Yes! There is a description, installation guide, dependencies, and it directs users over to the example notebooks for how to use it. The README is very succinct and does a good job.

**Lucas**: Yes. Lucas's README is very in depth with a very helpful image of what he was trying to accomplish. It shows requirements, installation, and basic CLI usage. The README is quite succinct but is very clear and shows that a lot of work went into the project.

**Vijay**: Vijay's README was very in depth and described the problems and tools very well. It also explains what is in every folder and where the example notebooks are. Vijay's README mentions that his project runs in Jupyter Notebooks so he has no scripts to put in the projects folder.

My notebook is a bit weird since my project is mostly run from notebooks and doesn't have a lot of dependencies but I think I could have done a better job of explaining what I was trying to accomplish with my project. An image like in Lucas's README would have been very helpful, I think.

**2) Did your peer have Python scripts in a directory named project, and were you able to understand the structure of the python scripts?**

**Montana**: No. Montana's scripts were in a directory named mappac (the name of her program). The scripts inside were easily understood and clean.

**Lucas**: Yes. Lucas's scripts are in a folder named project and the structure of the folder makes sense as well as the scripts themselves.

**Vijay**: No. Vijay's project is entirely in notebooks so he has no project folder with Python scripts in it.

**3) Did your peer provide example notebooks in the notebooks directory? Does the README file link to, or tell you about the example notebooks? Were you able to understand from the example notebooks how to use the code, or what your peer is trying to solve in the notebook?**

**Montana**: Yes, Montana has an example notebook of her program in use and it is referenced in the README. Like her actual script, the example notebook was easily understandable and spits out very pretty maps.

**Lucas**: As of my time of review (5pm 5/11), Lucas does not have any example notebooks but that is because his program is meant to be run through a command-line interface, not through Jupyter Notebooks.

**Vijay**: Vijay's notebooks were very clean and well explained. The notebooks had some weirdly formatted lines that were extremely long but other than that all the notebooks look good and showed Vijay solving his problem.

**4) Did you come up with any ideas for improving your own project by reviewing your peer's project directories?**

I focused on data visualization while my peers actually worked to solved problems using Python, so their projects aren't really comparable to mine. After reviewing their repos, I did realize that I should do a better job with making a README. Mine is quite messy and doesn't describe the project in detail very much. Since my project will continue being developed after this class, I will be making these changes to my README.
