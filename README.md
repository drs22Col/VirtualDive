# Visualizing Our Planet's Coral Reefs

PDSB project to create a bokeh app that visualizes over 10,500 reefs around the world and their name, reef type, predicted species composition, country, and GPS coordinates. Because this project is primarily meant to be a tutorial, users will primarily interact with Jupyter Notebooks. The most up-to-date and functional notebook is **VirtualDive-NASAdata.ipynb**.

To clone and run Jupyter Notebooks locally, clone this repo using

`git clone https://github.com/mistergroot/VirtualDive.git`

and navigate to the notebooks folder.

**Dependencies**:

Prior to running the aforementioned notebook, please install bokeh and colorcet by running:

`conda install bokeh colorcet`
