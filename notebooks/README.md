## This is where the fun begins.
To run through the entire process of creating a functional Bokeh app, following the following notebooks in this order:

1. `1-Download-Data-And-Cleaning.ipynb`
2. `2-Example-Bokeh-App-VirtualDive.ipynb`
3. `3-Embedding-With-Heroku.ipynb`

The rest of the notebooks are notebooks that are being actively developed. Don't view these unless you'd like to see my messy workflow and the inner workings of my mind.
