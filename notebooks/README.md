## This is where the fun begins.
To run through the entire process of creating and embedding a functional Bokeh app, following the following notebooks in this order:

1. `1-Download-Data-And-Cleaning.ipynb` **Optional**
2. `2-Example-Bokeh-App-VirtualDive.ipynb` **This is the main tutorial**
3. `3-Embedding-With-Heroku.ipynb` **Optional: Only if you want to learn how to embed your app w/ Heroku**

The rest of the notebooks in this folder are notebooks that are being actively developed. Don't view these unless you'd like to see my messy workflow and the inner workings of my mind (you don't want that).
